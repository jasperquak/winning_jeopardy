    "Let me explain in layman's terms how that works. Suppose that 30% of all Jeopardy questions are low-value questions and 70% are high-value questions. Now we are going to check for all questions that contains the term 'president'. Then we have an expectation that also for those, the ratio is 30% / 70%. If you find 29% / 71%: sounds still reasonable. If you find 10% / 90%: that looks suspicious though. With a chi-squared test one can calculate how likely such an observation still is under the hypothesis that the expected distribution is 30% / 70%. If that likelihood is very small (e.g. smaller than 5%) we reject the idea that the outcome is a mere coincidence, and conclude that the term 'president' is truly under- or over-represented (which one depends on the observation) in the high-value questions.\n",

    "It is very hard to defend though that any of this knowledge is going to help you prepare for Jeopardy a lot.\n",

    "One could certainly analyze more, e.g.:\n",
    "* Play with the functions developed in this notebook, e.g. to detect more terms that are overrepresented in high-value questions.\n",
    "* Do more thorough analysis. E.g. when comparing with history, only look at the past couple of years rather than to more than 20 years. Or look at combinations of terms rather than individual ones in questions.\n",
