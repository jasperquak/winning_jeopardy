# Winning jeopardy 

In this project, I explore more than 200,000 questions of American TV show Jeopardy from the years 1984 - 2012. Goal is to explore if there is something to learn from these questions.... in case you want to prepare yourself for winning!

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data analytics with [Dataquest](www.dataquest.io).
